# Romanize
Number Romanization Plugin For Sublime Text 3

sublime plugin that turns selected numbers (decimals) to romans or romans to decimals, depending on the selected characters

this plugin takes every selection in the view and gives you a choice, transform the decimal numbers to romans or vice-versa, if a selected number's value is to high (over 1,000,000,000) or is not an integer, that number will not be converted. If a selected roman number has character other than (M, C, D, L, X, V, I), upper or lower case the number will not be transformed. 
Finally, to romans and from romans functions are available only when text is selected
